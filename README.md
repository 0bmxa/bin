# bin
A collection of scripts I use to make my command line existence easier.

### ⚠️ Warning: ️⚠️
These are just some dirty, hacky scripts I wrote for myself with no intention
for them to be ever used by anyone else. There is no quality behind any of these
– neither in code style nor in functionality. I just put them on GitHub as
inspiration for others. I don't guarantee any stability or anything here.
